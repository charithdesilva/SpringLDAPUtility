This project was built to test out authentication and authorization capabilities of a given ldap store. This is a maven based project thus it should be easy enough to configure and build by your own. 

Basic functions 
---------------
 - Authenticate user against ldap store
 - Query primary membership roles 
 - Query all roles available for ldap store. 
 
Configure ldap store
--------------------
 - go to ldap.properties file and change store configuration. Currently the ldap is configured to be ldap.forumsys.com which is a public ldap store. 
 - properties are self-explanatory.
